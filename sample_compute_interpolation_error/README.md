# Sample Compute Interpolation Error

### This notebook serves to give a sense of  error from Scipy's interpolation function by calculating percent error between interpolated distributions and their known, actual value.

### While this notebook can not actually estimate the error of unknown distributions that are estimated via interpolation, it should give a sense of how accurate Scipy's interpolation function is on a given sample in a given dataset.
