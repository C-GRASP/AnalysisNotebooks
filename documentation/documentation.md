#### Sample_ID:

This unique ID is any unique ID provided from the source dataset. 


#### Sample_Type_Code:

This sample ranking, ranked by field is as follows: 
   * (1): A surficial sediment sample that is explicitly stated as coming from  on-shore, intertidal ,or supertidal either from the source project's documentation of location type or gathering method 
   * (2): An offshore surficial sediment sample gathered by a grab device
   * (3): A non-surficial sample (e.g. core) 
   * (N/A or Blank): not stated or known

#### Project:

Many databases compiled for this dataset were composed of different data sources. In this case, this field is populated by the specific project the relevant sample was gathered in

#### dataset:

The dataset that the sample was gathered from. For more specifics on each dataset, see below.

#### Date:

Date that the sample was gathered (not analyzed) standardized to yyyy-mm-dd format.

#### Location_Type:

If populated by "Beach?Y" the sample was specified to be gathered onshore through metadata or note information. If other, this field was populated by in the original dataset nomenclature of where on the beach a sample was gathered (e.g. berm, dune, intertidal, etc.)

#### Latitude & Longitude

The coordinates of a sample projected to EPSG:4326. Cases in which coordinates had to be reprojected can be found in the source data break-down below


#### Contact:

This is the the most relevant contact information that was able to be found for each sample, ranging in specificity from providing source agency to gatherer of the sample.

#### num_orig_dists:

This is the amount of cumulative distribution values (e.g. d10,d50,d90) that were provided with the sample. Other ones provided were extrapolated by the C-Grasp team.


#### Measured_Distributions

These are the distributions that were provided (accounted for in num_orig_distributions). All other provided cumulative distribution values were extrapolated by the C-Grasp team.


#### Grainsize

This field is populated when a sample grainsize was provided with a measurement, but with no further data specifying measurement. This most frequently occured with the US Seabed dataset in which the metadata says that grainsize is a measurement of "median or mean". Grainsize is in mm units.

#### Mean

Mean calculated using the Folk and Ward (1957) graphical moments method (Also see Blott & Pye, 2001). In mm units.

#### Median

This is provided when a sample's median grainsize was provided but differed from the interpolated d50 value.

#### Wentworth

Sediment grainsize classification from Wentworth, 1922.


 
#### Kurtosis

Kurtosis calculated using the Folk and Ward (1957) graphical moments method (Also see Blott & Pye, 2001). In mm units.

Listed below are the sources that we compiled for the overall dataset with notes on  the original provided descriptions, the given conditions of the dataset, where to access them, any alterations and decisions that were made by the C-Grasp Team, and any other relevant notes.


#### Dataset:Clark

This data was collected and provided by Dr. Clark Alexander, UGA Skidaway Institute of Oceanography using "Combined sieve (<4 phi) and Sedigraph (>4 phi) analysis technique" from onshore, beach samples from sampling campaigns on Jekyll Island, Sea Island, and St.Simons Island, GA in August, 2016.

##### The data used for C-GRASP provided in the source data are location & date data, sampling coordinates, and sample statistics in Phi (Mean, Sorting, Skewness, Kurtosis). These measurements were converted to mm units and date was standardized from dd-MM-YY to yyyy-mm-dd. The Sample_ID type comes from column comes from the dataset's "Station" field. Sample_Type_Code for all files is assigned to 1


#### Dataset: USGS East Coast Sediment Texture Database (https://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/project-pages/sediment/index.html)

<u>From Website </u> : The U.S. Geological Survey East-Coast Sediment Texture Database contains information on the collection, location, description, and texture of samples taken by marine sampling programs at the Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center. Most of the samples are from the Atlantic Continental Margin of the United States, a small number of samples have been collected from a variety of other locations such as Lake Baikal, Russia, the Hawaiian Islands region, Puerto Rico, and Lake Michigan. At present, the database contains about 28,000 samples, including texture data for approximately 3,800 samples taken or analyzed by the Atlantic Continental Margin Program, a joint U.S. Geological Survey/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution project conducted from 1962 to 1970 (Emery and Schlee, 1963; Hathaway; 1971). Texture data for approximately 24,000 samples analyzed by the Sediment Laboratory of the Coastal and Marine Geology Program of the U.S. Geological Survey, Woods Hole MA after 1980 make up the rest of the database. Although most records contain complete grain size analyses, some are simple bottom descriptions from rocky and bouldery locations where samples were not taken. Most of the samples were collected with some type of grab sampler; a few were obtained by coring. The information contained in this database is important because grain size is the most fundamental property of sediments. Geologists use information on sediment grain size to study trends in surface processes related to the dynamic conditions of transportation and deposition, ecologists use it when studying benthic habitats, engineers use it to study permeability and stability under load, geochemists use it to study kinetic reactions and the affinities of fine-grained particles and contaminants, and hydrologists use it when studying the movement of subsurface fluids (Syvitski, 1991). The basic structure of the database is a matrix where records are rows representing individual samples and the columns contain information on sample identification, navigation, classifications, analyzed parameters, and comments in 58 fields. The database, which can be accessed through the Data Catalog, is provided in three formats: comma delimited ASCII text (.csv), Microsoft Excel 2010 (.xls), and Esri shapefile (.shp).

#### Dataset: Louisiana Barrier Island Comphrehensive Monitoring Program ("dataset"== "bicms")(https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/gulf-of-mexico/science/barrier-island-comprehensive-monitoring-program-bicm)

From Website: The goal of the State of Louisiana Barrier Island Comprehensive Monitoring (BICM) program is to provide long-term data on the barrier islands of Louisiana that could be used to plan, design, evaluate, and maintain current and future barrier-island restoration projects. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has partnered with the Louisiana Coastal Protection Restoration Authority [CPRA] to help achieve these goals. The BICM program used both historical and newly acquired data to assess and monitor changes in the aerial and subaqueous extent of islands, habitat types, sediment texture and geotechnical properties, environmental processes, and vegetation composition. BICM datasets included aerial still and video photography (multiple time series) for shoreline positions, habitat mapping, and land loss; light detection and ranging (lidar) surveys for topographic elevations; single-beam and swath bathymetry; and sediment grab samples. Products produced using BICM data and analyses included (but were not limited to) storm-impact assessments, rate of shoreline and bathymetric change, shoreline-erosion and accretion maps, high-resolution elevation maps, coastal-shoreline and barrier-island habitat-classification maps, and coastal surficial-sediment characterization maps.

##### The data used for C-GRASP provided is merged from BICM data from 2008 and 2015 databases. In this source data are location & date data, sampling coordinates, 3 cumulative distributions provided for samples (d10, d50, d90), and sample statistics in micrometers (Mean, Skewness, Kurtosis). Date was converted from yyyymmdd to yyyy-mm-dd.  Measurements were converted to mm units. Coordinates were reprojected from Northings & Eastings (epsg:26915) to decimal degrees (epsg=4326). Cumulative distribution values were interpolated from the source data distributions via the methods in the Interpolation Notebook. The "Notes" field is composed of the source files' Lithology, sediment color,equipment, sample_type, geoloc, depth, depth and comments fields (among other relevant fields identified in the sample notes). Samples were collected on projects from dates ranging from 1955-2014. The "Sample_ID" column comes from the source data "SAMPLE_ID" field.




#### Dataset: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Marine Minerals Information System ("dataset"== "boem")(https://mmis.doi.gov/BOEMMMIS/)

From Website: "OCS sand and gravel resources are vital sources of material for the construction of coastal protection and restoration projects, including efforts to protect coastal communities, national defense facilities, and federal and state infrastructure. In recent years, there has been a growing demand for OCS sediment for planned projects, as well as for emergency needs to restore areas damaged by natural disasters. On a national scale, little is known about the character, quantity, and location of sand resources on the OCS and the habitat it provides for biological communities.

Proponents of planned infrastructure projects are requesting higher volumes of OCS sediment, driven by diminishing resources in state waters and a high frequency of recent storms along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. Further, given the significant number of other ocean users (e.g., energy infrastructure, fiber optic telecommunication cables, electrical transmission lines, and fisheries), BOEM strives to reduce or eliminate the potential for multiple use conflicts or environmental impacts that could result from marine minerals projects. This can make it challenging to identify new potential areas from which to borrow or dredge sediment.

As the system continues to grow and mature, BOEM plans to add more features and data sets.

Key MMIS features include:

 * More than30 years of BOEM-funded geological and geophysical research data
 * Data from more than40 partners in federal, state and local government, academia and other entities
 * A viewer with more than 20 available data layers
 * Sediment data offshore 18 coastal states
 * GIS-mapping capabilities
 * Tools to download data into geodatabases, shapefiles, or .csv files
 * Statistics on sand volume, number of projects, number of states, and use trends
Links to environmental studies and assessments, data from state cooperative agreements"
