# Sample Compute Percentiles

### Sample datasets typically provide raw measurments from sieves and/or calculated grainsize distributions (e.g. d10, d50, d90). The two notebooks provided in this repo show how to either calculate distributions from these measurements, or interpolate new distributions from ones provided within a sample dataset.

## Sample Compute Percentiles from Sample Measurements

### This notebook serves as a guide of how to calculate values for common, of interest sediment distributions (d10, d50, d90, etc), from datasets that only provide raw measurement data.

## Sample Compute Percentiles from Sample Measurements

### This notebook serves as a guide of how to calculate values for of-interest sediment distributions that are not provided within a dataset from other distributions that are provided. (i.e., calculate d5 from provided d10, d50, d90 values)
