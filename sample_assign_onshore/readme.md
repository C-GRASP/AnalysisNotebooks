# Sample Assign Onshore

## This notebook displays the process used to estimate whether samples were gathered on or offshore for sample datasets (Such as US Seabed) that did not contain metadata specifying sample location type (e.g. berm, dune, offshore, etc.) or sampling method type (e.g. hand sample, grab sample, core sample, etc.)
